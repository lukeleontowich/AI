Missionaries and Cannibals Problem:
Three missionaries and three cannibals are on one side of a river, along with a boat that can hold
one or two people. Find a way to get everyone to the other side without ever leaving a
group of missionaries in one place outnumbered by the cannibals in that place.
My Solution:
A* Search. See missionaries_cannibals folder for full details

Web Url:
Write a program that will take as input two Web page URLs and find a path of links from
one to the other. What is an appropriate search strategy? Is bidirectional search a good
idea? Could a search engine be used to implement a predecessor function?
My Solution:
Greedy bidirectional search. See web_url folderr for full details
